# LLM

This directory contains the details about:
- the prompts that we're using to labels the clusters and generate the AI summary.
- the prompts for conversation topics labeling 
- the prompts for the conversation feed recommendation algorithms

It will contain the Python scripts to run the prompt using the Agora database and LLM model.

Currently, the prompt we use is available as a set of default config in the `api` service: https://github.com/zkorum/agora/blob/main/services/api/src/app.ts#L95-L237
